#Low-Resource Language NLP Experiment: Ataya
This project explores simple NLP techniques for a low-resource language (Atayal),
including tokenization and basic corpus processing.

A low-resource NLP pipeline for the Zeyuan dialect of Atayal,
based on aligned text and audio data from Taiwan's K-12 curriculum.

## Project Goals
- Corpus statistical analysis
- Tokenization and preprocessing pipeline
- Character-level LSTM language model (PyTorch)
- (Optional) Audio feature extraction (MFCC)

## Results
- Corpus: 688 sentences, 1,851 unique words, 61 unique characters
- LSTM trained for 10 epochs, final loss: 0.3163
- Model successfully generates Atayal-like text
